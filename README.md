# Welcome to my Quiz Game!

[Demo](https://official-artem.github.io/quiz-game/)

## Introduction

I'm excited to share with you my latest project - an educational quiz game built using React and Vite. I chose to use Vite because of its fast build times and ease of use, making the development process smooth and enjoyable. I also had the opportunity to work with the mongoDB database, which was a new experience for me and allowed me to gain valuable insights into database management.

## Features

For the styling, I decided to use Bootstrap, which helped me create a visually appealing and responsive design for the game. The game allows users to:

* Answer questions
* Remove questions they don't like
* Keep track of their scores

Users earn 2 points for every correct answer and lose 3 points for every incorrect answer.

## Accessibility

I'm committed to ensuring that my project is accessible to everyone. Therefore, I've made sure to adhere to best practices in terms of accessibility, so that users with disabilities can also enjoy the game.

## Licensing

Finally, I've licensed this project under the GPL-3.0 license, which means that it's open source and free to use by anyone. You can find the details of the license in the LICENSE file.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback or suggestions for the project, feel free to open an issue on the project's GitHub page.
